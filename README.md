# Temporary_add_to_version_control
In this project, I've tried to implement Inventory Based Management System based on JSON. 
It's quite similar as guided by the our mentor on ETG internship lecture. The only difference is that I've added additional keys in record and deployed user-input functions.
Also I've tried to show the updation in the quantity of items after the consumer has purchased certain items.
